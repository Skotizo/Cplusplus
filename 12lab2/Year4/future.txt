In my future, I hope to graduate and move on to a job in incident responce. I wish to work for a company as thier first responder to analyze exploits and malware. It would really be wonderful to work from home and monitor a network. I think this is the path Id want to take because I had a lot of fun analyzing malware that was targeted at my webserver. This was something I learned from following other security researchers do similar things
