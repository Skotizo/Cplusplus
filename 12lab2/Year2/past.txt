Before I came to Scsu I was not sure what I wanted to do as a major. I had taken an AP computer science class in highschool and I realized that I wanted to do something with computer. I did not enjoy software development as much as I had wished but thats what I started as when I was a freshman. luckly, I did not have to choose a major immediatly which lead me towards taking cyber security because I had found myself liking that a lot more than developing
