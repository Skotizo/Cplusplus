Before I came to Scsu I was not sure what I wanted to do as a major. I had taken an AP computer science class in highschool and I realized that I wanted to do something with computer. I did not enjoy software development as much as I had wished but thats what I started as when I was a freshman. luckly, I did not have to choose a major immediatly which lead me towards taking cyber security because I had found myself liking that a lot more than developing
I have an interest in staying as a student at SCSU because this is one of the only schools I found that had a cyber security program. I also have made a lot of friends in my time in the dorm as a freshman so I always have support. This semster I have operating microsystems, calc 1, and computer architecture. Im happy that I am finally getting into my core classes. 
In my future, I hope to graduate and move on to a job in incident responce. I wish to work for a company as thier first responder to analyze exploits and malware. It would really be wonderful to work from home and monitor a network. I think this is the path Id want to take because I had a lot of fun analyzing malware that was targeted at my webserver. This was something I learned from following other security researchers do similar things
