I have an interest in staying as a student at SCSU because this is one of the only schools I found that had a cyber security program. I also have made a lot of friends in my time in the dorm as a freshman so I always have support. This semster I have operating microsystems, calc 1, and computer architecture. Im happy that I am finally getting into my core classes.
