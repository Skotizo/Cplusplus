1. Variables of a function that retain their value over multiple calls to the
function are called static variables.

2. In C++ all functions have local scope.

3. Default arguments are usually defined in the prototype of the function.

4. A function returning a value should never use pass by reference parameters.

5. Every function that begins with a data type in the heading, rather than the
word void, must have a(n) return statement somewhere, usually
at the end, in its body of instructions.

6 A(n) driver is a program that tests a function by simply calling it.

7. In C++ a block boundary is defined with a pair of {}.

8. A(n)	stub is a dummy function that just indicates that a
function was called properly.

9. Default values are generally not given for pass by actual parameters.

10. Overloaded functions are functions that have the same name but a
different parameter list.
