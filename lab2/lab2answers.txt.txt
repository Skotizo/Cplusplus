1. A constant is a memory location whose value cannot change
during the execution of the program.

2. Int is a data type that only holds numbers with no fractional
component.

3. Float/double is a data type that holds numbers with fractional
components.

4. % is an arithmetic operator that gives the remainder of a
division problem.

5. cout << is an example of the output statement fundamental instruction.

6. Boolean data types only have two values: true and false.

7. One byte consists of 8 bits.

8. // or /* in C++ indicates the start of a comment .

9. A variable is a memory location whose value can change during
the execution of the program.

10. A string can hold a sequence of characters such as a name.


EXERCISE 2.2
Change the data type of circumference from float to int. Run the
program and record the results.
The circumference of the circle is 33.
The area of the circle is 391.5624.
Explain what happened to get the above results.
Since I had changed the circumference's variable type, it no longer held any numbers after the decimal point. This removed all fractions from the number 33.


EXECISE 2.4

Exercise 3: Is it possible to change the choice of FAVORITESODA by adding
code within the main module of the program? Why or why not?
Its is not because FAVORITESODA is a constant. The memory space cannot be modified after execution.
Exercise 4: Is it possible to change the choice of favoriteSnack by adding code
within the program? Why or why not?
it can because the variable mutable. It can take on many different value throughout the program as long as not specified as a constant.
